This frontend project is built using NextJS, MaterialUI, SWR, and runs on port (http://localhost:3000) while backend runs at http://localhost:2428/chats.

Starting app will get a random user that has a list of chats available.
Starting a conversation will create a new thread with this user.

Still need to make use of the endpoint to check whether user already has thread started.
